- Well done! Now you can declare and initialize a String array and an int array to fetch text String and number int variables. Unfortunately, Kyle made a mistake listing out his superheroes, and you need to change the name and introduction date of one of them.

# Step 1:- 
- Change the name of one of the superheroes in the String array.
 # üñ•Ô∏è It‚Äôs time to get coding!

 - TODO 3: Here, you need to change or modify the name of one of the superheroes. To do this, you can use a statement like superheroes[0] = "Black Widow";. Can you guess which element of the array you would change with this statement? That‚Äôs right, the first!

# Instructions:

* Remove the first TODO 3a block and write a statement to print the original name of the superhero at the third position (Remember: Position and index aren‚Äôt the same thing!)

* Remove the second TODO 3b block and write a statement to modify the name of the superhero at the third position to ‚ÄúThor‚Äù.

* Remove the third TODO 3c block and write a statement to print the new modified name of the superhero at the third position.

# Run the code in your IDE.

- Print the original and modified superhero name.

- Compare the output to the expected results
